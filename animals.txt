You make me want to be a more obedient dog.

Are you a cat because you're purrrrrrfect.
Are you feline the connection between us?
Baby, we only got 9 lives.
Be mine it's meow or never
Don't purrcrastnate just be mine
How you feline? Cause you purrfect, I’m not kitten!

Haven’t I sniffed you someplace before?
I’m looking for a no-leash-attached cuddle buddy.

Roll over. I’ll scratch your belly
What a cute puppy. One day you’re going to be as beautiful as your Mommy
