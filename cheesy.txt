Are you a parking ticket? Cause you’ve got fine written all over you
My buddies bet me that I wouldn’t be able to start a conversation with the most beautiful girl in the bar. Wanna buy some drinks with their money?
Stand still so I can pick you up!
For a moment I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Now I see that I am very much alive, and heaven has been brought to me
Baby, if you were words on a page, you’d be what they call fine print
I was wondering if you had an extra heart mine seems to have been stolen
I wanna live in your socks so I can be with you every step of the way
I don’t have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out?
I’m not a photographer, but I can picture me and you together
I’m not drunk. I’m just intoxicated by you
Your legs must be tired because you’ve been running through my mind all night
Excuse me, but I think I dropped something. MY JAW!
How much does a polar bear weigh? (how much?) Enough to break the ice… Hi, I’m (your name)
Do you have a map? I’m getting lost in your eyes
I must be a snowflake, because I’ve fallen for you
Would you grab my arm so I can tell my friends I’ve been touched by an angel?
If I told you that you had a great body, would you hold it against me?
You shouldn’t wear makeup. It’s messing with perfection
When God made you, he was showing off
I know milk does a body good, but baby, how much have you been drinking?
You see my friend over there? He wants to know if you think I’m cute
Your hand looks heavy. Let me hold it for you
You know, you might be asked to leave soon. You’re making the other women look really bad
You’re so beautiful that you made me forget my pickup line
Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off?
You must be yogurt because I want to spoon you
Damn, if being sexy was a crime, you’d be guilty as charged!
Can I read your t-shirt in braille?
If there was no gravity on earth i'd still fall for you.
