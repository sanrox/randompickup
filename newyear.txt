Alright girls, which one of you ordered a male stripper?
Anyone can buy you a drink. I'd like to buy you dinner. 
Can I be your first mistake of the New Year?
Can I be your new year's wrecking ball?
Can I get your cell so I can text you a New Year's kiss?
Do you have a New Year's Resolution? I'm looking at mine right now.
Do you know it's unlucky to be so good looking and not have anyone to kiss at midnight?
Do you want to see two balls drop?
Don't leave too early... the last thing I want to say to you before we part is 'good morning'.
Got anyone to kiss at midnight?
Have you had enough champagne to believe I'm handsome yet?
Have you had enough to drink to believe I'm handsome and charming yet? 
Hi, I'm Mr. Right. I heard you were waiting for me. 
How do you like your eggs? Would you like to come over for breakfast? 
I can think of better place to pour champagne.
Kiss me if I'm wrong, but it's 20__ now, right?
Looks like we're the only ones still standing... let's get out of here!
My condom expires end 20__. Do you want to help me use it?
My New Year's resolution is you. 
Next year without you would be like a broken pencilâ€¦pointless.
Nice party hat. Wanna f*ck?
Someone said you were looking for me. I'm your new year's resolution.
That's a nice 20__ dress! Can I talk you out of it?
Use a cinema classic as you clink glasses: "Here's lookin' at you, kid." 
Wanna ring in the New Year with a bang?
Wow. You're gorgeous. My new year's resolution is going to be to make you my girlfriend
