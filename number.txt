They say dating is a numbers game… so can I get your number?
I seem to have lost my phone number. Can I have yours?
I want to tell you something, but it’s too inappropriate to say aloud. Let me text it to you?
How am I supposed to shamelessly flirt with you in the middle of the night when I don’t have your number?
Sorry, I don’t talk to strangers. But if you put your number in my phone, we won’t be strangers anymore.
truth or dare
My friends over there bet that I wouldn’t be able to get a phone number of a hot girl like you. Want to buy some drinks with their money?
Pick a number between 1 and 10 (3?) Sorry you lost, you’ll have to give me your number!
What’s your favourite number? Mine’s yours.
