Please call 9-1-1, my heart just stopped for you
Are you a camera? Because I smile every time I see you
If kisses were snowflakes, I’d send you a blizzard
If you were a fruit, you would be a fineapple. And if you were a vegetable, I would visit you every day in hospital
You know what you’d look really beautiful in? My arms
I think you’ve got something in your eye. Oh never mind, it’s just a sparkle
Would you touch me so I can tell my friends I’ve been touched by an angel?
Are you going to kiss me or are you going to make me lie to my diary?
Are you a girl scout because you tie my heart in knot.
Caution: Please keep your distance. I might fall… for you
If I had a dime for every time I thought of you… I’d have one dime… coz you never left my mind
If beauty were time, you’d be an eternity
If I were a letter in the alphabet, I’d be Q, so I could always be next to U
May I have the distinguished honor and privilege of sitting next to you?
You’re so sweet, you’re giving me cavaties
You’re so cute, it’s distracting
Baby, you must be a broom, cause you just swept me off my feet
Can you give me directions to your heart? I seem to have lost my way in your eyes
What time do you have to be back in heaven?
Excuse me, I think you have something in your eye. Oh wait, it’s just a sparkle
Please help the homeless. Take me home with you...
It's dark in here. Wait! It's because all of the light is shining on you.
You couldn't break my heart, because it melted when I saw you
There's this movie I wanted to see and my mom said I couldn't go by myself..
